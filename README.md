This notebook is the 17th data science talk and the 7th Deep Dive challenge and event.
This project is a classification task for different types of medical images that I did with two different models including ResNetV2.


In this challenge, we are going to develop a model to classify a dataset of medical images into six different classes. The dataset consists of 58,954 64x64 pixel images that have been preprocessed to resemble the style of the MNIST dataset. The classes include Abdomen CT scan, Breast MRI, Chest X-ray, Chest CT scan, Hand, and Head CT scan.

The primary objective of this challenge is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately classify medical images into their respective classes. You can explore various algorithms, architectures, and techniques to achieve the highest possible accuracy.

For example your model should be able to predict that this picture belongs to the class of Abdomen CT scans:

Solving this classification task holds significant potential in various medical applications. Here are a few examples:

1. Automated Diagnosis: Accurate classification of medical images can assist healthcare professionals in the diagnosis process, providing them with additional support and reducing the risk of human error. An automated system could offer valuable insights and aid in the early detection of diseases or anomalies.

2. Personalized Medicine: Precise classification of medical images can contribute to personalized treatment plans for patients. By accurately identifying the affected area or condition, medical professionals can tailor their interventions, medications, or therapies to optimize outcomes and minimize unnecessary procedures.

3. Research and Development: Robust classification models can support researchers in analyzing large volumes of medical images. By automating the classification process, researchers can focus their time and expertise on investigating patterns, conducting studies, and developing new insights into various medical conditions.
